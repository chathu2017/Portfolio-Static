Personal Portfolio Website for Niwantha Wickramasingha
This is the official repository for my personal portfolio website. It is a fully responsive, single-page application designed to showcase my skills, experience, and projects as a Cloud Engineer. The site features a modern, interactive design with a focus on user experience and visual appeal.

üîß How to Customize
This portfolio is designed to be easily customizable.

1. Personal Information
All text content (names, job titles, descriptions, etc.) can be edited directly in the index.html file within the relevant sections (e.g., #home, #about, #experience).

2. Images
Replace niwantha.png and niwantha-fav.png with your own profile picture and favicon.

Place your project images (e.g., project-01.jpg, project-02.jpg) in the root folder or an images subfolder and update the src attribute in the <img> tags.

3. Adding a New Project
The project popup navigation is fully dynamic. To add a new project:

Navigate to the <section id="projects"> in index.html.

Copy an existing <div class="project-card" ...>...</div> block.

Paste it after the last project block.

Crucially, update the data-index attribute to the next number in the sequence (e.g., data-index="4" if the last one was 3).

Update the image src, title, and the content inside the hidden .project-full-content div.

The navigation in the popup will automatically include your new project.
